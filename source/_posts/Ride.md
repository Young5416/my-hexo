I've been out on that open road

You can be my full time, daddy,white and gold

Singing blues has been getting old

You can be my full time, baby,hot or cold

Don't break me down

I've been traveling too long

I've been trying too hard

With one pretty song

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast

I am alone in the night

Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I

I've got a war in my mind

So, I just ride, Just ride

I just ride, I just ride

Dying young and I'm playing hard

That's the way my father made his life an art

Drink all day and we talk 'til dark

That's the way the road doves do it, ride 'til dark

Don't leave me now

Don't say goodbye

Don't turn around

Leave me high and dry

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast

I am alone in the night

Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I

I've got a war in my mind

I just ride, Just ride

I just ride, I just ride

I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy

I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes

It's all I've got to keep myself sane

Baby, too much I strive, I just ride

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast

I am alone in the night

Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I

I've got a war in my mind

I just ride, Just ride

I just ride, I just ride

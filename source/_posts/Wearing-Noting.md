All I hear is the rhythm of my speeding heart

It's getting loud and I can't hide it

Boy, you know the distance is just killing me

Even when I lied right beside ya

And I gotta let my body loose

Never really cared for rules

I gotta get it closer to you

I gotta get to where you are

Rip my shirt and let it fall

Baby, I just feel like wearing

Nothing at all

When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing

Nothing at all

When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing

Yeah I'm getting warmer as you're holding me

But I still feel too far away now

Help me please 'cause I can't deal with clothes between us

I just wanna tear 'em off baby

And I gotta let my body loose

Never really cared for rules

I gotta get it closer to you

I gotta get to where you are

Rip my shirt and let it fall

Baby, I just feel like wearing

Nothing at all

When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing

Nothing at all

When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing

Baby let's tie us tighter together

Yeah we can tear down this wall

We got to get tighter and tighter together

When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing

I gotta let my body loose

I gotta get it closer to you

I gotta get to where you are

Baby I just feel like wearing

Nothing at, nothing at

Nothing at all

When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing

Nothing at all

When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing

Baby let's tie us tighter together

When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing

We got to get tighter, tighter together

When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing

**当時9歳にして堂々とWoolyの表紙を飾った琉花。10年経った今、モデルだけでなく写真家としても活動の幅を広げている彼女に、自身の2nd zine ”VOYAGE 2017 in Sri Lanka”販売を記念して今回インタビューを行った。**  

 **Luka, who was the cover model of Wooly at age of 9, now expands her activities by not only being a model but also a photographer after 10 years. We had a chance to do an interview with her as she publishes her 2nd Zine, “VOYAGE 2017 in Sri Lanka”**。

**Why did you decide to create a zine ?**

> I had a stock of photos that I had taken for years. When I was organizing my photo exhibition I came up with an idea of creating a zine with them at the same time. Soon then I decided the title “VOYAGE” and started making it.

**What is the most memorable events in Sri Lanka?**

>I always wanted to stay at the hotel designed by Geoffrey Bawa, and the dream came true so it was the best. Another thing is that on the way back home our luggage didn’t come out after waiting for an hour. It was weird because there were only four people before us. Though we luckily didn’t miss the flight the staff was not upset at all. Maybe time passes very slowly in Sri Lanka.

**We heard that you also visited some Sri Lanka restaurants in Tokyo. Do you have any recommendations？**

>I recommend “Acala naatha” in Nakameguro. It’s so good. Sri Lanka dishes are cooked with coconut oil so it is not nauseous even if you eat a lot. In the local you mix many kinds of curry and rice with your hands on one plate. It was so delicious. I’d like to try cooking it someday.

****You were only 9 years old when you did the cover of Wooly, and now you are 20. What do you think has changed?****

>At that time I was so shy that I couldn’t talk at all. Now I am more comfortable talking to someone. Maybe I couldn’t have made any friends if I didn’t change. In high school there were many interesting, unique people so I had to appeal myself to be recognized.

****What would you want to try from now ?****

>I would like to take more portraits of people of my age since most of my photos have been landscape. Recently I have been taking photos of Sena from the same company, and I will continue this project.

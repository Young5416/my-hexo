Don't know where I am with you

Forgetting time and space with you

Oh I wish we had a common view

You've seen my red as blue

I don't belong in your universe

For better or for worse

I'm the same but I'm bolder

You'll get home but I'm on my way out now

Not the same destinations

I will stay when you get off the train

You're as safe as a mountain

But know that I'm dynamite

Oh you're as safe as a mountain

But know that I'm dynamite

Your hand is warm but my heart is blue

Is blue now

I miss you but I've got things to do

Oh I wish we had a common view

You've seen my reddest blue

I don't belong in your universe

For better or for worse

I'm the same but I'm bolder

You'll get home but I'm on my way out now

Not the same destinations

I will stay when you get off the train

You're as safe as a mountain

But know that I'm dynamite

Oh you're as safe as a mountain

But know that I'm dynamite

Know that I'm dynamite

Know know that I'm dynamite

Know that I'm dynamite

Oh it's so cold here

Cause I left my heart to be with you

Oh it's so cold here

Cause I left my heart to be with you

I'm the same but I'm bolder

You'll get home but I'm on my way out now

Not the same destinations

Know I will stay when you get off the train

You're as safe as a mountain

But know that I'm dynamite

Oh you're as safe as a mountain

But know that I'm dynamite

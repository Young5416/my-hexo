And I hate to say I love you

When it's so hard for me

And I hate to say I want you

When you make it so clear

You don't want me

I'd never ask you cause deep down

I'm certain I know what you'd say

You'd say I'm sorry believe me

I love you but not in that way

And I hate to say I need you

I'm so reliant

I'm so dependant

I'm such a fool

When you're not there

I find myself singing the blues Can't bear

Can't face the truth

You will never know that feeling

You will never see through these eyes

I'd never ask you, cause deep down

I'm certain I know what you'd say

You'd say I'm sorry believe me

I love you

But not in that way

You'd say I'm sorry believe me

I love you

But not in that way
